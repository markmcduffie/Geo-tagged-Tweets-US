# Geo-tagged tweets
Here is a map of geo-tagged tweets across the US over a 60 second time period collected on January 25th, 2021. 
I collected every tweet by filtering them to contain the word "Biden", in reference to the recent inauguration.
The distribution of tweet throughout the map i logical, as clusters of tweets were found near major US population centers 
such as Los Angeles and New York. Additionally, there were little to no tweets coming from sparsely populated places such as 
middle America and Alaska. Overall I think that the longer we collect tweets, the more the map will look exactly like 
the population distribution of the United States.
